Duration: May to june,2025
# Overview of the Project:
# Project: Student Grade Tracker
# Objective:
The primary objective of the Student Grade Tracker project is to develop a user-friendly and efficient system that enables students, teachers, and academic institutions to accurately record, manage, and analyze student grades. The system aims to streamline the grading process, provide real-time academic performance insights, and support data-driven educational decisions to enhance student learning outcomes.
# Key Activities:
# Requirements Analysis:
Gather requirements from stakeholders (students, teachers, administrators).
Define project scope and key features (user authentication, grade entry, reports, etc.).
# System Design:
Design the database schema (students, courses, grades, users).
Create wireframes or mockups for the user interface.
Choose the technology stack (frontend, backend, database).
# Technologies Used:
Java: The programming language used for development.
ArrayList: Used for storing student data dynamically.
Scanner: Used for reading user input from the console.
# Program Structure:
Student – represents a student with their numerical and letter grade.
GradeUtils – contains utility methods for computing letter grades and statistics.
StudentGradeManager – manages the list of students, input/output, and coordination.
Main – the entry point of the application.
# Compilation and Execution:
# Prerequisites
installed java development kit
# Compilation
Save the code as StudentGradeTracker.java.
Open a command prompt or terminal.
# Compile the code:
javac StudentGradeTracker.java
# Execution
Execute the compiled code:
java StudentGradeTracker
# Usage
This project is a console-based Java application that allows teachers (or educational admins) to enter student scores, convert them to letter grades, and compute useful statistics like average, highest, and lowest grades.

# Future work
- Multi-Language Support: Enable the system to support different languages for wider accessibility.
- Integration with Learning Management Systems (LMS): Connect the grade tracker with platforms like Moodle or Google Classroom for seamless data synchronization.
- Automated Feedback & Suggestions: Provide AI-generated feedback on student performance, including study recommendations.
- Data Persistence: Implement functionality to save and load student data from files (e.g., CSV, JSON) or a database.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Develop a graphical interface using libraries like Swing or JavaFX for a more interactive experience.
